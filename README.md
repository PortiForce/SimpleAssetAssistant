# SimpleAssetAssistant

SimpleAssetAssistant is a lightweight .NET-based asset management core for tracking asset activity, holdings, and aggregated portfolio insights across multiple platforms.

## Why

- asset activities (trades, exchanges, rewards)
- platform accounts and balances
- multi-platform aggregation

without overengineering or premature complexity.

## Scope

- Asset and platform abstractions
- Activity-based trading and exchange history
- Aggregated holdings and summaries

## Non-goals (for now)
- Tax calculation
- Event sourcing / multi-leg transactions
- Automated trading

## Status
